I assume all of them will roughly be the same; but stll which has a slight edge (Money transfer; benifits etc) Thanks !!!	Q268_R4_C1	Commercial bank/IBQ	Q268_R4_C2	The best bank in Qatar for you would be the one that fits in your requirements.I suggest you visit the major banks here; and approach the Customer Relations person there to guide you with the facilities the bank offers. They include: -Current Accounts facilities -Savings Account facilities - Money Transfer (However; I highly recommend using the bank transfer only in emergency cases. There are money transfer agents which offer better exchange rates; and lower service fees) - Tie-ups with any bank in your home country to ease transfers	Q268_R4_C3	- Credit / Debit card facilities - Customer Care services - Promotional services - Bank Loans facilities; etc. I recommend that you visit the nearest banks and gather all info.it'll just take you a couple of days to arrive at the decision.

Q268	Good Bank	Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	Q268_R5	What is the best bank to open an account?	Seems like all the banks need the salary to be credited to their accounts [where I came from that was not a necessity]. So it sort of limits my choices. Can anyone recommend me a bank that has good interest rates on loans and credit cards? So far I'm considering Doha Bank because of the Lulu card. Is it worth it? :)	Q268_R5_C1	IBQ... if your salary is 25k above you will have a banking officer that will take care of your needs...	Q268_R5_C2	West bank ????	Q268_R5_C3	qatar islamic bank	Q268_R5_C4	If your salary is QR35K or more you can opt for QNB with their QNB First facility which allows you to use the airport lounges around the world; a faciltiy which comes in handy when travelling economy class. Also using their Master Card (credit card) gets you miles with Qatar Airways which you can use for travel. And there services in last 5 years of my being a customer has been excellent. (P.S: I dont work for or with QNB).	Q268_R5_C5	What about for salary less than 5k?

The account will be used to get my salary paid into and transfer funds overseas. Thanks	Q268_R10_C1	I used to use CBQ when I first got here; but I wasn't happy with the service and products - now I use QNB and its fairly ok. But when it comes to sending money back home; CBQ still offers better exchange rates.	Q268_R10_C2	Doha Bank Ltd is mostly preferred by the salary class.	Q268_R10_C3	No worries bank ... QNB ... Be with the Royals ....................................................	Q268_R10_C4	CBQ is the better option	Q268_R10_C5	Most of the banks here provide good service to the salaried class and I hardly see much difference among them. You should select a bank where your company has a bank account as it will allow your salary get credited to your account very quickly each month.	Q268_R10_C6	Agree with acchabaccha - go with the same bank as your company. Unless you plan to take out a loan in the near future; then go with the bank that you're most likely to get the best loan offer from.	Q268_R10_C7	CBQ...

Can you please advise on the best bank to deal with here? Thanks	Q268_R13_C1	This really is a subjective matter. Do a search of the forum and you'll come up with lots of results on banks and their services.	Q268_R13_C2	is best tellin u from my personal exp. am dealin with them for last 8 years never had any problem. HSBC really got atittude ommercial bank will give you alot but when time comes for pay back they will start suckin ur blood so is with doha bank . :D [img_assist|nid=21285|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]	Q268_R13_C3	best international HSBC best local Commerical Bank these are my point of view	Q268_R13_C4	POSB - Post Office Saving Bank IBSB - International Blood Sucking Bank HSBC - High Society Bullshitting Corporation	Q268_R13_C5	LOL !!!	Q268_R13_C6	"This topic has been widely covered in many previous threads. Use the search engin to find several forum topics that treated this subject. The bottom line is: there is no such thing as ""best bank"". The concept of Customer service and satisfaction is unknown; they are all sub-standard; procedures and response time: light-years away from western banks. Choose from the names mentioned above; the most convenient for you to use."	Q268_R13_C7	The one and only best bank is QNB; in my 14 years of experience	Q268_R13_C8	Any idea about CBQ? [img_assist|nid=22259|title=*|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=135|height=180]	Q268_R13_C9	avail the lowest interest rate for car loan?	Q268_R13_C10	Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.
Q268	Good Bank	Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	Q268_R14	Best Credit Card in Doha	I would like to apply for a credit card that gives me Points when i spend and not just a simple card that does not get me anything in return for using it... Which card would you recommend gives the most reward for using the card and which card should i stay away from??

Q268_R14_C8	How about American Express Card?	Q268_R14_C9	I recommend QNB credit card; you earn Qmiles whenever you use it and so you can redeem awards in Qatarairways privilege club. you can also use the airport lounges.	Q268_R14_C10	I've heard good reviews of Doha Bank CC. I have a platinium CC from CBQ. I used to earn miles with QA but they stopped the same from last year. They still charge me QAR 500 . Customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa points but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol. Awesome. QAR 500 bucks for a useless silver card - sorry platinium.
Q268	Good Bank	Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	Q268_R16	Best Bank.	Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	Q268_R16_C1	banks are using us ... Talk to those who had taken a credit card or loan to know more ...	Q268_R16_C2	In Qatar that is like saying which is the best STD.	Q268_R16_C3	I'm surprised to see such feedbacks on Qatar banks... Is there any serious problem with banks here? Please share if any one had a bad experience before. I'm using commercial bank and till now I'm OK with their services.	Q268_R16_C4	Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.	Q268_R16_C5	With QNB for last 4 years plus...no issues...great service with a smile (mostly) from Qatari's (yeah dont be surprised) and now since they started QNB First it just got even better...:)	Q268_R16_C6	WesternInDoha; that's the information that I am looking for and it answer my question. Cheers...	Q268_R16_C7	MoltenMetal; it depend how you are looking on the subject matter and the point of view; as the if the glass half empty or half full !!! There are fees for the service; I wish that we don't need banks and you reminded me of old days where we put the gold and the money in bags and bury them in the ground ;) Good Luck..	Q268_R16_C8	That's new way of description for the Bank's... I am planing to do the same; let the company deposit the salary in the bank account and I will ignore it for some time ;) Cheers...	Q268_R16_C9	I don't know if it is the high competition? or No competition?? Is there any review issued by Central Bank? or any magazine ?? Is there any benchmark based on customer feedback?? When I searched QL there are so many disappointed and negative feedback from from bank clients I don't see the reasons behind it?? Regards;	Q268_R16_C10	Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.
Q268	Good Bank	Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	Q268_R19	Islamic Banks in Qatar	Any idea about good Islamic banks in Qatar? Services / products wise? Recommendation / experiences Is there any Islamic services @ commercial bank ?	Q268_R19_C1	I know Ahli Bank has Islamic branch; QNB; Commercial Bank; even HSBC got Islamic products.	Q268_R19_C2	they are the Best :P [img_assist|nid=13339|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]	Q268_R19_C3	yes QCB does have an islamic banking section by the name of Safa. infact it is an independent branch. they have good saving and long term accounts also.; it is on salwa road i believe. will check and tell you.	Q268_R19_C4	Although they don't have the satisfactory Customer Service level; I will still recommend them as it's pure Islamic Services. I; personally; don't accept the idea of islamic service from a commercial bank.	Q268_R19_C5	Customer service at Safa was rather good. It is particularly suited to ppl who receive their salary at QCB but want to save the islamic way!easy cash tranfer.	Q268_R19_C6	My dads been in banking all his life and thinks its just an eyewash!!! Its just the same commercial banking labelled Islamic!he thinks we are all fools to follow it so blindly! any comments???	Q268_R19_C7	All what I can tell you that you should not go to International Islamic bank. Not just bad customer service; they are bad at everything	Q268_R19_C8	they will never be accepted banking that way. Some strategic plannings are made and than that approved by the Sharia according to Islamic Laws and than Approved by ministry of Religious afairs. not that u just go make a billboard which says QCB islamic Branch.no never. [img_assist|nid=13339|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]	Q268_R19_C9	Hi Lamea! im kinda new in here but what I know about islamic banking is that they got much lower rates and a certain portion is donated to their Muslim Communities who need help - gotta think from the more positive angle since we are living in their world we gotta live by it. Otherwise go to America or Europe instead but for me Islam and Islamic banking is good. Just a thought. No offense meant ok? Cheers!

Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.

GK; u have see what exactly u want from ur bank; what's ue requirements and what's important to u? the min balance? branch near ur house? good internet/phone banking? product range (apart from standard debit and credit card stuff)? interest rate on ur savings and deposits? investment products? best customer service? nobody can really give u a proper answer if u will come and ask which bank is the best in here :o) If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.

I went to one and talked to the 'customer relationship officer' about opening an account and to each one of my question; he had to guess an answer :) any how; i guess only experience will tell. ------------------------------------------ Quidquid latine dictum sit; altum sonatur.	Q268_R29_C10	Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards
